# Suhana's Caltech Cryptograms!

Welcome to my cryptogram game! Inside, there are three cryptogram puzzles of my favorite parts of Caltech that I saw on my visit this year.

An overview:
1. There are three puzzles in total that must be solved in order.

2. Text boxes have letter and number of times this letter appears in parentheses.

3. Click on a hint button to get a hint.

4. Enter all letters in uppercase.

5. You can click 'submit' when you're finished to see if you got the correct answer!
